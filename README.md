# Barista Web APP Project


### Goal: 

A Web App that allows users to input their names, and the order that they want to input. When you click submit, send the users order to the baristas profile page. Here you can signup for an account and view what orders have been submitted. Next you can check off the completed box and you will hear your order being processed via audio as well as updating the UI by moving the incompleted order to the completed orders section.
